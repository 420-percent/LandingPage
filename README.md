# 420% DAO
Welcome to 420% DAO, a Polygon-based decentralized ecosystem revolutionizing cannabis culture by preserving non-feminized landrace strains (e.g., Hindu Kush, Moroccan Beldia) through a Web3 seed bank and tokenized assets. Our Q3 2025 MVP launches 420.baby, a dApp (React, Tailwind CSS) offering 500-1,000 ERC-721 NFT memberships ($300/year) with $280 in perks (3 seeds, merch: hoodie, T-shirt, stickers, more), plus trading (1-5% cut), royalties (20-40% + 1-5% license fees for breeders), voting, and digital seed/weed/extract tokens (ERC-721/1155, $8/seed bulk). Seven smart contracts—MembershipNFT, StrainLicense, FractionalizationPool, StrainToken, RoyaltyDistribution, DAOGovernance, Treasury—enable strain licensing, fractional trading, and governance. Built in-house to save $31,000-$55,000, we’re targeting $150,000-$300,000 in user funds, $100,000-$200,000 from VCs, and a $15M-$20M valuation in the $55.9B cannabis market. Join us at MJBizCon (Nov 4-7, 2025), contribute code, or DM @go420percent to preserve cannabis heritage with breeders (ILGM, DNA Genetics) and VCs (Entourage Effect, HALLEY)!
